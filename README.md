# 💀 viole(n)t — Wrocław University of Science & Technology CTF team
Welcome to the GitHub home of **viole(n)t** (aka **C Hasztag**) — a student‑driven Capture‑the‑Flag crew that hacks for fun, research and glory.  
Here you’ll find the projects, write‑ups and cheat‑sheets that power our quests for flags and (occasionally) podiums.

## 🤝 Contributing
We ❤️ PRs. If you have a cleaner exploit, smarter script, or just spotted a typo:

1. Fork, branch, hack.
2. Follow the repo’s lint/format hooks (`pre-commit run --all-files`).
3. Describe **what** and **why** in the PR body.
4. Tag a maintainer (`@violent‑maintainers`) for review.

For bigger ideas, open a discussion first.
